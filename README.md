# Keyboard Layout in German without stupid accents

German keyboard layout for MacOS without the need to press ```SPACE``` everytime you want to type ~ or ^.
I was not motivated enough to add all secondary keybindings to the layout feel free to make a pull request.

# Tools used
- [Ukelele](https://software.sil.org/ukelele/) 
*you can customize the layout with this software, edit it how you like*

# Installation
1. Put the ```Custom German Layout.keylayout``` file into the ```/Library/Keyboard Layouts``` directory.
2. Reboot 
3. Open System Preferences and navigate to Keyboard > Input Sources add a new layout, scroll down to others and select ```PC-Tastatur, Deutsch```
4. Select the input method from the menu bar or delete every other layout in the left panel with the minus button if you don't need another keyboard layout
